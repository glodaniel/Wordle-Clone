# Wordle-Clone
This is for the CIS 1051 final project.
This is a Python program that is a clone of the popular New York Times game, Wordle.  
The player is given 6 tries to guess a 5 letter word. 
A title will turn green if the letter is in the word and in the correct spot. 
A title will turn yellow if the letter is in the word but, in the wrong spot. 
A title will turn black if that letter is not in the word.
