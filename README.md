# Wordle-Clone

## Preproposal
This is for the CIS 1051 final project.
This is a Python program that is a clone of the popular New York Times game, Wordle.  
The player is given 6 tries to guess a 5 letter word. 
A tile will turn green if the letter is in the word and in the correct spot. 
A tile will turn yellow if the letter is in the word but, in the wrong spot. 
A tile will turn black if that letter is not in the word.

**Collaboration**:
Anusha Ghimirey

**Question**:
How will I be able to include colors to indicate if letters are or aren't part of the word using Python?
